# Brain-Tumor-Classification

The aim of the project was to build and train CNN model which is able to classify X-Ray brain images as either tumorous or not. It was my first project where I was working with PyTorch. I also performed some image preprocessing with OpenCV.

Making use of a Transfer Learning technique I was able o build a model that reaches over 90% accuracy on a validation set.
