# Brain-Tumor-Classification

The aim of the project was to build and train CNN model which is able to classify MRI brain images as either tumorous or not. It was my first project where I worked with PyTorch. I also performed some image preprocessing with OpenCV.

Making use of a Transfer Learning technique I was able to build a model that reaches over 90% accuracy on a validation set.
