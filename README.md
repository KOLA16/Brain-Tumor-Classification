# Brain-Tumor-Classification

The aim of the project was to build and train a CNN model which will be able to classify MRI brain images as either tumorous or not. The project was treated as a learning exercise in using PyTorch. Additionally, some image preprocessing was done with OpenCV.

Making use of a Transfer Learning technique I was able to build a model that reaches over 90% accuracy on a validation set.
